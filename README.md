# Synthetic Flow Estimation

Synthetic flow estimation is the generation of a very long record of synthetic river flow data, from which the flow duration curve (FDC) is subsequently estimated.

The procedure is articulated in the following steps:

- A generation model is identified, calibrated and validated.
- The long record is generated.
- The FDC is estimated.

This examples uses the river Po, which runs through the city of Piacenza, Italy.
